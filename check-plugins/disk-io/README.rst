Check disk-io
=============

Overview
--------

Checks the disk throughput over a period of time. The check tracks the maximum throughput and warns if the throughput over the last n readings is above a certain percentage (by default 80/90% over the last 5 readings). This works similar to Load5, but at the disk I/O level.

Disk I/O always starts with 10 MiB/sec, but stores the highest measured throughput, so it adjusts the ``RWmax/s`` value accordingly. For this reason, this check takes some time to warm up its (cached) readings: The check will throw some warnings and criticals during the first major disk activities above 10Mib/sec until the maximum throughput of the disk has been determined.

Example: The result of ``./disk-io --count 5 --warning 80 --critical 90`` could look like this:

.. code-block:: text

    dm-0: 23.6MiB/s read, 17.2MiB/s write (current)

    Disk ! RWmax/s ! R1/s     ! W1/s     ! R5/s     ! W5/s     ! RW5/s

    sda1 ! 10.0MiB ! 729.6KiB ! 154.2KiB ! 732.0KiB ! 152.4KiB ! 884.4KiB           
    sdb  ! 46.0MiB ! 22.9MiB  ! 17.0MiB  ! 22.4MiB  ! 18.4MiB  ! 40.8MiB [WARNING]  
    sdb2 ! 46.0MiB ! 22.9MiB  ! 17.0MiB  ! 22.4MiB  ! 18.4MiB  ! 40.8MiB [WARNING]

The first line always shows the disk with the currently highest throughput (here ``dm-0``).

The table columns mean:

* RWmax: Here, a maximum throughput of 44.9 MB/sec was determined.
* R1, W1: The current throughput is 23.6 MB/sec read and 17.2 MB/sec write.
* R5, W5: The throughput from now to 5 measured values in the past is 23.1 MB/sec read and 18.6 MB/sec write.
* RW5: Compared to the current values, there was a higher throughput for a while. Since a maximum of 44.9 MB/sec throughput has been measured for this disk so far, a mean throughput (RW5) value of 41.7 MB/sec results in a warning (``41.7 MB/sec >= 44.9 MB/sec * 80%``). The current value of 23.6 MB/sec doesn't matter, this is only a peak. The check alerts because there is unusual high disk I/O over a certain amount of time.

Hints:

* ``--count=5`` (the default) while checking every minute means that the check reports a warning if any of your disks was above a threshold in the last 5 minutes.
* The check uses the SQLite databases ``$TEMP/linuxfabrik-monitoring-plugins-disk-io.db`` to store its historical data.
* If you are wondering about ``dm-0``, ``dm-1`` etc.: It's part of the "device mapper" in the kernel, used by LVM. Grant sudo permissions to the check plugin to see what is behind it.

      -V, --version    show program's version number and exit
      --always-ok      Always returns OK.

                       before alerting. Default: 5
      --critical CRIT  Set the CRIT threshold for disk I/O read/write rate over

                       rate. Default: >= 90
      --ignore IGNORE  Ignore disk names starting with a string like "sr"

Troubleshooting
---------------

``Query failed: INSERT INTO "perfdata" ...``
    Delete ``$TEMP/linuxfabrik-monitoring-plugins-disk-io.db`` and try again.

``psutil raised error "not sure how to interpret line '...'"`` or ``Nothing checked. Running Kernel >= 4.18, this check needs the Python module psutil v5.7.0+``
    Update the ``psutil`` library. On RHEL 8+, use at least ``python38`` and ``python38-psutil``.
