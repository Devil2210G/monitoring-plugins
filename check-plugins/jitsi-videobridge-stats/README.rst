Check jitsi-videobridge-stats
=============================

Overview
--------

Checks the number of participants on a Jitsi Videobridge (v2.1+) and returns a bunch of performance data using the `REST version of the COLIBRI protocol <https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-videobridge/blob/master/doc/rest-colibri.md>`_.

The `statistics <https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-videobridge/blob/master/doc/statistics.md>`_ are available through the ``/colibri/stats`` endpoint on the *private* REST interface that `must be activated first <https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-videobridge/blob/master/doc/rest.md>`_.

The check does not convert the ``total`` values into discrete values. Instead, all totals are reported as "continous counters", otherwise the duration of the conferences will not be displayed nicely on the timeline, for example.

For a discussion on how many users Jitsi support see `here1 <https://community.jitsi.org/t/maximum-number-of-participants-on-a-meeting-on-meet-jit-si-server/22273/2>`_, `here2 <https://community.jitsi.org/t/update-on-maximum-number-of-participants-on-jitsi/97695/2>`_ and `here3 <https://meetrix.io/blog/webrtc/jitsi/how-many-users-does-jitsi-support.html>`_

    Checks the number of participants on a Jitsi Videobridge and returns a bunch
    of performance data using the REST version of the COLIBRI protocol.

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
      --always-ok           Always returns OK.
      -c CRIT, --critical CRIT
                            Set the CRIT threshold for the number of participants.
                            Default: >= 100
      --insecure            This option explicitly allows to perform "insecure"
                            SSL connections. Default: False
      --no-proxy            Do not use a proxy. Default: False
      -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                            Jitsi API password.
      --test TEST           For unit tests. Needs "path-to-stdout-file,path-to-
                            stderr-file,expected-retc".
      --timeout TIMEOUT     Network timeout in seconds. Default: 3 (seconds)
      --url URL             Jitsi API URL. Default: http://localhost:8080
      --username USERNAME   Jitsi API username. Default: None
      -w WARN, --warning WARN
                            Set the WARN threshold for the number of participants.
                            Default: >= 25


Usage Examples
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

    ./jitsi-videobridge-stats --warning 25 --critical 100

Output:

.. code-block:: text

    2 participants in 1 conference (2 participants in the largest conference), 2 Video Channels, Stress Level 0.00848, 75 JVM threads, 1.4Mbps download, 961.3Kbps upload


States
------

* WARN or CRIT if the current number of participants exceeds the specified thresholds.
